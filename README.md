# CERIF Refactoring Pilot Model Use-Cases
The model use-cases for the CERIF Refactoring Pilot project implemented 
using the [CERIF Core](https://github.com/EuroCRIS/CERIF-Core) and some modules.

## [UC#1](./UC1/): Researcher Moving Institutions
A researcher is willing to move from a country to other (e.g. France to Australia) to a different institution. 
It is expected that his profile and vitae may be transferred electronically to the new institution via a standardised model and format that can be digitally signed as a verifiable claim or verifiable credential 
(following the directions of the [W3C working group of the same name](https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/WG/)).

## [UC#2](./UC2/): Project Reporting
Partners in a multinational project funded under the EU H2020 programme need to share project participation data electronically with the coordinator for reporting under the particular rules of a scheme or call. 
The partners include non-EU members, e.g. from China.

## [UC#3](./UC3/): Infrastructure Search
A researcher is looking for a research infrastructure for a very concrete physics experiment 
and wants to know if there are e-infrastructures available in other countries 
that he could eventually use, with or without paying for it.
